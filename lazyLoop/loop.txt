program /opt/python27/bin/python27 ~/bin/TEsim.py #program to run
output /data/robert.williamson/temp/loopTest/ #output folder
processes 2#maximum number of processes
replicate 2#number of replicates
#will use parameters in order
#if "?" is provided as param name, it will not use a flag on the parameter, jut put it directly in
#i.e if the first line was "? 2"
#the program here would always execute: TEsim.py 2 -T ... -N ... -G ... > OUTPUT
#if the first line was: ? OUTPUT .txt
#then the first thing in the line would be the aggregated output filename (see below)
#i.e. TEsim.py T2_N10_G5.txt -T 2 -N 10 -G 5 (assuming the last line in this file did not exist)
-T 2 5#list of parameters followed by all options
-N 10 100
-G 5 10
> OUTPUT .txt#if the argument is OUTPUT it will make an output filename by concatenating all the options for this run together, it will give the file ending given after OUTPUT
